# level2
*_TASK 1_*
Got introduced to two new computer softwares for designing an electronic circuit.
Figured out how to use LTspice to to design an astable multivibrator using 555 timer. Having calculated the values of the resistors in level 1 task 13, I tried to directly use the values of resistors as 3k and 6k ohms and 2 capacitors of 0.01 micro farads each to get a duty cycle of 60 percent.

Also learnt how to use KiCad to design a simple led blinking circuit(using a 7555 timer).
