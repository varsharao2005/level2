*_TASK 1_*


Got introduced to two new computer softwares for designing an electronic circuit.
Figured out how to use LTspice to to design an astable multivibrator using 555 timer. Having calculated the values of the resistors in level 1 task 13, I tried to directly use the values of resistors as 3k and 6k ohms and 2 capacitors of 0.01 micro farads each to get a duty cycle of 60 percent.

Also learnt how to use KiCad to design a simple led blinking circuit(using a 7555 timer).

*_TASK_*

So, the aim of the task was to be able to control the speed and direction of the two motors, driven by the motor driver L293D. Having done tasks in level 0, I found this to be easier except there two motors instead of one and I faced few errors. So, after taking help from MARVEL coordinators I was able to finally able to make sure that the motor rotated. I learnt that the two pins of the EnA have to be shorted and similar thing to be done in casE of EnB.
